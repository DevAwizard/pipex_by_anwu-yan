### **Project Overview**

### **Introduction to Pipex**
`Pipex` is a project aimed at understanding and implementing the **piping mechanism in UNIX**. The goal is to create a program that mimics the behavior of the shell in handling input/output redirection between commands. By completing this project, you'll deepen your understanding of UNIX system calls like:
- `pipe()`
- `fork()`
- `dup2()`
- `execve()`

### **Objectives and Goals**
- **Replicate the functionality** of this shell command:
  ```bash
  < infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile
  ```
- **How it works**:
   - Takes two commands.
   - Reads input from a file.
   - Pipes the output of the first command into the second command.
   - Writes the final output to another file.

### **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- **System**: Unix-based system (e.g., Linux, macOS)
- **Compiler**: GCC or any standard C compiler
- **Knowledge**: Familiarity with system calls like `fork()`, `pipe()`, `dup2()`, `execve()`
- **Makefile**: A Makefile that compiles with `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wextra` flags, without relinking unnecessary files.

### **Required Functions and Libraries**
You'll use these functions:
- `open()`, `close()`, `read()`, `write()`
- `malloc()`, `free()`
- `perror()`, `strerror()`
- `access()`, `dup()`, `dup2()`
- `execve()`, `exit()`, `fork()`, `pipe()`, `unlink()`
- `wait()`, `waitpid()`

### **Project Structure Overview**

#### **File Descriptions**
- **`pipex.h`**: Header file containing function prototypes, macros, and structures.
- **`pipex.c`**: Contains the core logic, handling pipes, redirection, and command execution.
- **`utils.c`**: Includes helper functions for string manipulation, memory handling, and more.
- **`Makefile`**: A script that compiles your project and manages cleanup tasks.

### **Program Usage**

### **How to Run the Program**
Use the following format to run the `pipex` program:
```bash
./pipex infile "cmd1" "cmd2" outfile
```
- **`infile`**: Input file to be read.
- **`cmd1`**: First command.
- **`cmd2`**: Second command, takes `cmd1` output as input.
- **`outfile`**: Output file where results will be stored.

### **Example Commands**
```bash
./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile
```
- **Input**: `infile`
- **Command 1**: `ls -l` (lists files)
- **Command 2**: `wc -l` (counts lines)
- **Output**: Written to `outfile`

### **Expected Input and Output**
- **Input**: The contents of `infile`
- **Output**: The result of the commands, piped together, written to `outfile`


### **Core Logic and Implementation**

To better understand the **core logic**, please refer to the **visual diagram** below, which outlines the entire process:

Here’s a brief overview of the steps:

1. **Setting up the `PATH` Environment**  
   The program retrieves and parses the `PATH` variable to locate executables.

2. **Command Parsing and Validation**  
   Each command is validated and located, ensuring it's executable.

3. **Pipe Creation and Redirection**  
   Pipes are created to link the output of the first command to the input of the second.

4. **Forking Child Processes**  
   Two child processes are created to run the commands concurrently.

5. **Executing Commands**  
   Commands are executed using `execve()`, which replaces the current process with the new one.

6. **Closing File Descriptors**  
   Properly closes all file descriptors to prevent resource leaks.


### **Error Handling**

1. **Common Errors**:
   - **Invalid Command**: Prints "Error: Command not found" and exits.
   - **Permission Denied**: Handles permissions issues when reading or writing files.
   - **Broken Pipe**: If the first command fails, the program handles the failure gracefully.

2. **Systematic Error Messages**:
   - Custom error messages are shown for incorrect arguments, permission errors, or failed system calls.


### **Memory Management**

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**  
   All dynamically allocated memory (e.g., for command arguments) must be freed after use to avoid memory leaks.

2. **Avoiding Memory Leaks**  
   Use tools like `valgrind` to check for memory leaks and ensure all allocated memory is freed properly before the program exits.



### **Tester - Mandatory Part**

#### Non valid cases:

#### 1. **Wrong Number of Arguments**:
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "cat" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error message (e.g., "Error: Invalid number of arguments") and exit.
  - **Reason**: The mandatory part requires exactly 4 arguments (infile, command1, command2, outfile). Any deviation should trigger an error.

#### 2. **Non-existent Input File**:
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex nonexistentfile "cat" "wc -l" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Could not open input file` and exit.
  - **Reason**: If `infile` does not exist, the program should handle this error gracefully, informing the user that the input file cannot be opened.

#### 3. **No Read Permission on Input File**:
- **Command**: `chmod -r infile && valgrind ./pipex infile "cat" "wc -l" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Permission denied for input file` and exit.
  - **Reason**: If the program cannot read the input file due to permission issues, it should handle this error gracefully.

#### 4. **No Write Permission on Output File**:
- **Command**: `chmod -w outfile && valgrind ./pipex infile "cat" "wc -l" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Permission denied for output file` and exit.
  - **Reason**: If the program cannot write to the output file, it should handle this error gracefully.

#### 5. **Non-existent Command (Invalid Command)**:
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "invalidcommand" "wc -l" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Command not found` and exit.
  - **Reason**: If `execve()` cannot find or execute the command, the program should catch the error and inform the user that the command is invalid.

#### 6. **Invalid Permissions on a Command**:
- **Command**: `chmod -x /bin/cat && valgrind ./pipex infile "/bin/cat" "wc -l" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Permission denied for command /bin/cat` and exit.
  - **Reason**: If a command exists but lacks execution permissions, the program should handle this and exit with a meaningful error message.

#### 7. **Empty Input File**:
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex emptyfile "cat" "wc -l" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should write `0` to `outfile` since the input file is empty.
  - **Reason**: An empty input file is a valid case, but it can lead to a `wc -l` output of `0`. Ensure the program handles empty files correctly and outputs the expected result.

#### 8. **Broken Pipe**:
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "invalidcommand" "wc -l" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should handle this gracefully without crashing or leaving file descriptors open.
  - **Reason**: If the first command fails, there’s no output to pipe to the second command. The program should handle the broken pipe case and avoid hanging.

#### 9. **Invalid Output File Path**:
- **Command**: `./pipex infile "cat" "wc -l" /invalid/path/to/outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Could not open output file` and exit.
  - **Reason**: If the output file path is invalid or points to a directory that doesn’t exist, the program should handle this error.

#### 10. **File Descriptors Exhaustion**:
- **Command**: Test a scenario where too many file descriptors are open, preventing the program from opening more pipes or files.
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Too many open files` and exit gracefully.
  - **Reason**: In cases where the system runs out of available file descriptors, the program should handle this failure scenario gracefully.

#### 11. **Invalid Path in Environment**:
- **Command**: Modify the `PATH` environment variable to an invalid path, then run:
  ```bash
  PATH=/invalid/path valgrind ./pipex infile "cat" "wc -l" outfile
  ```
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Command not found` for both `cat` and `wc -l`.
  - **Reason**: If the `PATH` environment variable is invalid, commands like `cat` and `wc` won’t be found, and the program should handle this case gracefully.

#### 12. **Output File in a Read-Only Directory**:
- **Command**: Create a read-only directory and try writing an output file to it:
  ```bash
  mkdir readonlydir && chmod -w readonlydir && valgrind ./pipex infile "cat" "wc -l" readonlydir/outputfile
  ```
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Permission denied for output file` and exit.
  - **Reason**: If the output file cannot be created due to directory permissions, the program should fail gracefully.

#### 13. **Incorrect Syntax (Quotes Not Handled Properly)**:
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "cat" "'wc -l'" outfile`
  - **Expected Behavior**: The program should print an error like `Error: Invalid syntax or command not found` and exit.
  - **Reason**: If quotes are not handled correctly in commands, this can lead to the command being passed incorrectly to `execve()`. The program should identify and handle incorrect syntax.


### Valid Command Combinations for Two Commands

#### 1. **Word Count**
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "cat" "wc -w" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `cat` reads the contents of `infile`, and `wc -w` counts the words, writing the result to `outfile`.

#### 13. **Display the First 5 Lines of the File**
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "head -n 5" "cat" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `head -n 5` reads the first 5 lines from `infile`, and `cat` writes it to `outfile`.

#### 14. **Display the Last 5 Lines of the File**
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "tail -n 5" "cat" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `tail -n 5` reads the last 5 lines from `infile`, and `cat` outputs them.

#### 15. **Find Files in a Directory and Count Matching Files**
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "ls -l" "grep 'txt'" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `ls -l` lists files in the directory, and `grep 'txt'` filters files that contain "txt" in their names.

#### 16. **Unique Lines from a File**
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "cat" "uniq" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `cat` reads the content of `infile`, and `uniq` filters out duplicate consecutive lines.

#### 17. **Sort and Remove Duplicates**
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "sort" "uniq" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `sort` sorts the lines alphabetically, and `uniq` removes duplicate lines.

#### 18. **Replace a Word in the File**
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "sed 's/old/new/g'" "cat" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `sed 's/old/new/g'` replaces all occurrences of "old" with "new" in the file.

#### 19. **Count the Occurrences of a Pattern**
- **Command**: `./pipex infile "grep -o 'word'" "wc -l" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `grep -o 'word'` prints each occurrence of the word "word", and `wc -l` counts how many times it appeared.

#### 20. **Display File Content with Line Numbers**
- **Command**: `valgrind ./pipex infile "cat -n" "cat" outfile`
- **Explanation**: `cat -n` displays each line with its line number, and `cat` writes it to `outfile`.
